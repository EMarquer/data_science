    "    Your presentation should clearly indicate which parts of the assignments was covered and which was not and it should summarize the results obtained. If you want , you can additionally present a specific point about your work e.g. a code fragment you are particularly proud of or some issue you found with the data/results. This part is free and optional. \n",
